Data Warehouse Project!

In this project, I applied the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process to integrate data from multiple CRM & ERP sources. The workflow was divided into three main stages:

ðŸ”¹ Bronze (Extract) â€“ Load raw CSV files into staging tables using DDL/DML & Bulk Insert, preserving data as-is.
ðŸ”¹ Silver (Transform) â€“ Perform data quality checks, cleaning, validation, and standardization to ensure consistency.
ðŸ”¹ Gold (Load) â€“ Build Dimension & Fact Views in a Star Schema, enabling reporting, dashboards, and business insights.

This project demonstrates how raw data can be transformed into business-ready analytics, providing a strong foundation for decision-making.

ðŸ“Š Tech Stack: SQL Server (DDL, DML, Stored Procedures, Views)
ðŸ“‚ Dataset: Advanced SQL Project
